   - Free plan available
   - Form submissions appear in dashboard

2. **Switch to Formspree** (works on GitHub Pages)
   - Free for 50 submissions/month
   - See `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for setup

3. **Use Web3Forms** (works on GitHub Pages)
   - Completely free
   - No account needed
   - See `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for setup

### Placeholder Content
Your site has placeholder images and example testimonials that should be replaced before public launch. See `CHECKLIST.md` for details.
